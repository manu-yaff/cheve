## Short paragraph

By every ton of glass beer bottles recycled we reduce a total of 1.2 tons of raw material that are used in energy intensive processes. In an impact analysis every beer bottle that is reintroduced into the market saves 1.025 KWh of energy which translates into approximately 430 kg of CO2 emissions removed from the atmosphere. Using products like Cheve is a perfect example of how we can be a contributor into creating sustainable, regenerative and circular economies, while getting rewarded in the process!
